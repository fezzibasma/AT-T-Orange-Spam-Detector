# AT&T Orange SMS Spam Detector🕵️‍♀️

One of the main pain point that AT&amp;T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.  AT&amp;T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT\&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals 🎯
Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based sollely on the sms' content.
Write a notebook that runs preprocessing and trains one or more deep learning models in order to predict the spam or ham nature of the sms
State the achieved performance clearly


# Result 
## Sequential Model ( training less than 1 min for 50 epoches )

mmh seems like the easiest model is the best!
